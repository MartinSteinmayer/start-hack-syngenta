## Value proposition

### Highest crop productivity,
### Highest return for farmers

In our portfolio we have a biostimulant for row crops able to ensure **highest productivity and return for farmers**.

This solution is able to increase plant productivity through:
- Better transport of sugars and nutrients
- Promotion of cell division
- Fatty acids biosynthesis and transport

## DIRECTIONS FOR USE

| Crop | Dose | Period of application | Crop | Dose | Period of application |
|------|------|------------------------|------|------|------------------------|
| Wheat | 2 l/ha | 1 application at flag leaf growth stage | Rice | 1-2 l/ha | 2 applications: the 1st at the beginning of booting, the 2nd at heading growth stage |
| Soybean | 1-2 l/ha | 2 applications: the 1st at Vn/R1 growth stage, the 2nd at R3/R5 growth stage | Cotton | 2 l/ha | 2 applications: the 1st before squares appear and 2nd after 3-4 weeks |
| Corn | 2 l/ha | 1 application at V4-V6 growth stage | Sunflower | 2 l/ha | 1 application at 4-6 leaf growth stage |

## Science behind

### TRANSCRIPTOMICS

**Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)** experiment on corn and soybean: plants treated with Yield Booster showed activation of genes involved in:

- **Transport of sugars and nutrients**: Zn and Fe uptake and transport, ammonium and nitrogen assimilation, phosphate homeostasis (uptake, sensing), phloem loading.
- **Promotion of cell division**: the coordination of specific hormonal processes, including the establishment of an optimal auxin/cytokinin balance.
- **Fatty acids biosynthesis/transport**: lipid transport, photosynthesis

### PHENOMICS

Experiments on corn and soybean, where Yield Booster improved:
- Digital Biovolume and height
- Plant compactness
- Green Index

## Field trials
