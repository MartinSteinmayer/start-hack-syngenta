# Nutrient use efficiency (NUE) products

This product decision is taken before the growing season based on the historical data and upcoming season prediction.

## Different factors influence that can limit the availability of Nitrogen, Phosphorus and other nutrients:

* ammonia volatilization, nitrification, denitrification, immobilization.
* Leaching, runoff, temperature, soil pH, soil texture, rainfall and irrigation, soil salinity, tillage, weeds, pests, diseases, nutrients loss from plants, crop rotation, crop nutrition, crop varieties.
* Nutritional management (right time, right source, right place, and right rate/amount).

## Nutrient Use Efficiency (NUE) products

are biological products that are used for **fixing Nitrogen**, Phosphorus solubilization, improving nutrient availability and uptake, and promoting plant growth and soil health.

Our NUE product for seed treatment and foliar application

*Seed treatment & Foliar application*

## Value proposition

New innovative product concept based on 3 strains endophytic bacteria (*Sphingobium salicis, Pseudomonas siliginis, Curtobacterium salicis*) with dual effect on N and P use efficiency and mineral nutrient uptakes.

### Plant available N from multiple sources:
- Air – N2
- Soil – NO, NO3, NH3/NH4
- Soil – Organic, C-NP

### Enhanced phosphate mobilization and uptake
- Enhanced P-solubilization
- P and K uptake root to shoot transport
- Organic acid

### Enhanced macronutrient + micronutrient availability
- Siderophore production solubilization of micronutrients Fe, Mg, Cu, Zn, Mn, Mo.

## Science behind

**38 trials in corn (US, EU) 2023. 40-unit N reduction scenario - FOLIAR**

- 68%-win rate (positive response)
- Average 2.6% yield increase
- Average 250 kg/ha increase

## KEY BENEFITS

- Product acts as a «back up generator» for plants when nutrients become limiting
- Versatile and easy to apply: seed treatment or foliar application.
- Up to 2 years of shelf life.
- High compatibility with tank mixtures(F, I, H, F).
- Trial data in key field crops.
