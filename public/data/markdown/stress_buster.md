# The Stress Buster product card

The Stress Buster - Abiotic stress Recovery

This product can be applied as soon as a stress event is predicted.

*Foliar application*

## Value proposition

### Anti-stress and growth activator

Our comprehensive portfolio include biostimulant that contains a complex of selected vegetal extracts derived from selected plants.

- When applied in case of abiotic stresses, its synergistic action of different active ingredients, allows the plants to tolerate and quickly overcome the stress, preserving yield.
- Applied regularly in normal condition, optimizes plant growth.

## DIRECTIONS FOR USE

| Crop | Dose | Period of application |
|------|------|------------------------|
| Fruit crops | 2-3 l/ha | pre-flowering, post-setting fruit development and in all cases of plant growth stop |
| Vegetable | 2-3 l/ha | in open field and greenhouses after transplant every 10-15 days |
| Row crops | 2-3 l/ha 150-250ml/hl | 1-2 applications during growth cycle in case of abiotic stresses |

## Science behind

### TRANSCRIPTOMICS

**Non-stressed plants** treated will show activation of >100 genes (FC >3) vs. Control, mainly involved in: i) abiotic stress response/tolerance ("hardening effect" against abiotic stress), ii) activation of plant metabolism (thus better growth)

**Drought-stressed plants** pre-treated with stress buster show a decreased expression of stress-related marker genes during stress conditions, showing a lower perception of the stress itself ("acclimated plants"; Petrozza et al., 2014)

### PHENOMICS

Under normal and stress conditions (drought, cold, heat-shock, flooding, simulated hail), Megafol improved:
- "Digital Biovolume/Biomass"
- Health index (less Stress Index)
- Water content
- Other indexes: Green/Yellow Index, etc

### METABOLOMICS

METABOLOMICS has also been used recently, to highlight the action of Stress Buster in stress conditions. It has been observed that the product is capable of modulating specific classes of metabolites, connected to the response to abiotic stress.

Clear benefit of application on Arabidopsis plants under normal and drought stress conditions. These results were confirmed by metabolomics data.

## Our Field Trials

### Performances on crop groups (ROI*)

Total average yield increase on all crops refers to selected trials done with The Stress Buster

#### Row crops
- \+ 0,30 t/ha
- **3,9:1**

#### Vegetable
- \+ 2,3 t/ha
- **11,6:1**

#### Fruit crops
- \+ 1,2 t/ha
- **10,5:1**

*\*Return on investment (ROI) is calculated by dividing the profit by the related investment, based on an average value in the European market.*

*\*\*850 selected trials for the summary, of which 68% were carried out under abiotic stress conditions.*
